The LSX Blog Customiser will let you create the type of blog you want, showcasing your content in the layout and with the right metadata that you decide is important.

== Description ==

The [LSX Blog Customiser](https://lsdev.biz/lsx/extensions/blog-customizer/) is developed for the LSX Theme to customise the blog layout for your archive pages and single blog posts. The main blog page is also customisable using this extension.

In addition to a beautiful blog you can also add a layout switcher for users to change between grid and list view.

Use LSX Search to index and create filters for your blog page. Searching your blog content allows users to be in control of what they want to see.

It allows you it to customize various aspects of the the appearance of your blog, posts widgets, archive pages and single posts so they looks exactly how you want.

= Free Companion Theme =

LSX Team is built to show off the best of the WordPress block editor, but it requires the free LSX theme in the WordPress theme repository as the perfect companion for LSX Blocks - https://wordpress.org/themes/lsx/

= Block Editor Support =

The LSX theme is full compatible with the WordPress block editor. This means you can now make use of the drag-and-drop page builder when creating new pages and posts.

[LSX Blocks](https://lsdev.biz/lsx/extensions/blocks) is an extension with blocks designed to display perfectly with the LSX theme. The blocks plugin extends various WordPress core blocks to be more flexible with the WordPress theme.

The combination of LSX Theme & LSX Blocks gives you a true page builder experience using the WordPress Gutenberg block editor.
